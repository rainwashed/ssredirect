User Agreement Clause

This living document will outline the rules when using SSR. SSR will stand for stupidly simple redirect, as well as I, US, and OURS will refer to this as well.

Like the project, the rules are stupidly simple:
- Do not use SSR to spread illegal content such as malware, child pornography, gore, and other illegal shit.
- Do not DDOS SSR for fun. A cloud container is NOT cheap and I am operating this project for free.
    - Using automated scripts to generate CUTs is okay, though please be mindful of the rate in which you are doing so and the CUTs you decide to occupy.
- Any vulnerability within the software should be notified to I through either GitHub or my email, rain@rainwashed.xyz
